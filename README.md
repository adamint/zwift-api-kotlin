# Zwift API Kotlin (unofficial)
Hello Zwift developers, this library is only meant to be used for research purposes.

###Interesting tidbits:
- Zwift shares an enormous amount of information about each rider. It is conceivably possible 
to constantly poll for updates on entire worlds and build out a leaderboard. All that's required is a large data 
storage method. 
- We can do research on cyclists on the Zwift platform by taking advantage of world and status polling, even without the explicit 
consent of users. An example will be provided.
- Known player types:
  - Zwift Staff: ZWIFT_STAFF
  - Normal user: NORMAL
